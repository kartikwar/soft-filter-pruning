1.) Train the model from scratch without pruning, save it in a directory.
----Run the file original_train.py

2.) Train the model from scratch with pruning, save it in a directory.
----Run the file pruning_train.py

3.) Infer  1 on validation set and see time taken.
----Run the file original_train.py with param -e

4.) Infer 2 on validation set and see time taken
----Run the file infer_pruned.py 

sh scripts/infer_pruned.sh





YUgal Steps:


1.) Give Unpruned model ----same as step 1

2.) Pruned model from scratch ---------- step 2

3.) Remove zeroes from pruned model and save the model
